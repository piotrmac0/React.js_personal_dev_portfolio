My personal developer portfolio website created in React.js with animations in Framer-motion and Sass, and what's the best - content management system in Sanity.io 
This awesome frontend + backend combination allows me to dynamically render every content on this portfolio app in very fast and easy, even for non-technical user way.
It's is in my opinion so powerful and awesome in-use full-management system.
